# Meta-Learning to Improve Pre-Training
This folder contains code to run experiments in the paper Meta-Learning to Improve Pre-Training, NeurIPS 2021.  Please refer to the README files in the `multitask/` and `simclr` folders for experiments in the mutlitask PT and self-supervised PT domains, respectively. 

We also include a self-contained notebook that can be run on Google Colab to examine the synthetic MNIST data augmentation domain [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k5sc7Ij1wxCRFdD7aObJmuj6qdBcEFdm?usp=sharing).
